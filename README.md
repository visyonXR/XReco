### Abstract

This repository will publish the **open-source components developed by Visyon360** within the **XRECO Project (XR Media Repositories for eXtended Reality Content)**.  
The release will include the **XRCapsule web solution**, featuring the **web and Unity source code of the XRCapsule Player**, the **documentation of the JSON specification** defining the XR Capsule data model, and a collection of **associated services and modules** that can operate **either integrated within the XRECO ecosystem or as standalone components**.  

This open-source publication aims to promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration within the XR research and production community by sharing the technological foundations that enable interoperable and cloud-based XR experiences.
